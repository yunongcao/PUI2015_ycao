### Review on the plot made by Github user: sarangof

The user has trouble with her Github repo and has not upload her plot on github yet, so the URL is not available temporarily. Here is the plot sent to me by email.

In terms of clarity, the plot is very easy to read with all axes labelled clearly. However, it would definitely be better if the unit of y axis (Frequency) were added.

The plot is both clear and beautiful. The color of the line are welly chosen. The combination of line and background color forms a good contrast which allows me to focus on the scatter. It would be even be perfect if the size of the plot were larger.

Finally, The plot honestly reproducing the data. Everything made sense and there was no distortion in this plot.
