In terms of clarity, the plot is generally easy to read with all axes labelled clearly. However, I can not really read the height(z coordicate) clearly. Maybe using different color in some sepcific coordiate(for z axis only)range is a better idea.  

The plot is both clear and beautiful. The size and color of the scatter are welly chosen. The combination of scatter and background color forms a good contrast which allows me to focus on the scatter.  

Finally, The plot honestly reproducing the data. There is no distortion.
